### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Vik, front-end developer, UA.
In early 2020, I began to actively study the Javascript programming language and the direction of front-end development.
I am actively engaged in self-education. Thanks to technologies and opportunities, this is one of the most popular areas for complementary education today. This is considered to be the most common new mode of learning, offering opportunities to learn new skills.

I am sure that my previous experience will help me to quickly enter a new interesting field of activity and open a new phase in my professional development.

Skills:
 - GIT
 - HTML/ CSS 
 - JAVA SCRIPT (Basic level)
 - SASS
 - REACT (Basic level)
 - NODE.js (Basic level)

Languages:
 - UA (native)
 - RU (native)
 - EN (B2)
